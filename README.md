# Powershell Functions
Welcome to my Powershell Functions Repo! 
My goal is to make it easier for the Help Desk supporters
Just clone the repo and run it in your powershell:
```powershell
. ./functions.ps1
```
Alternatively, you can define the file in $PROFILE Environment Veriable so the functions will automatically run everytime you open a powershell shell
```powershell
$PROFILE = ./functions.ps1
```
I hope you will find the functions beneficial!
